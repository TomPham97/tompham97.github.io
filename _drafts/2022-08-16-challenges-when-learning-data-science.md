# 5. There are too many possibilities to learn data science
When given a lot of options to choose from, people tend to become overwhelmed, as described by the paradox of choice (or [choice overload](https://thedecisionlab.com/biases/choice-overload-bias)). While people frequently believe that having more alternatives is a good thing, research has shown that in many instances, having more options makes it more difficult for us to make a decision.

People who seek to learn data science often encounters the same issue, with ever-increasing amounts of options to choose from. 

# 4. Data science is too technical
While the field employs lots of advanced statistics and algorithms, one does not necessarily need to have a PhD in math in order to implement practical solutions using data.

Technical knowledge is important but should not be the main emphasis. As described by Dr. Rachel Thomas 

# 3. Absence of peers with a common interest
Forums, communities such as reddit, stack overflow
