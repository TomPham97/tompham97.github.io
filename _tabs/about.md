I'm Tom Pham, a self-taught data scientist focusing on machine learning and deep learning. I am interested in implementing artificial intelligence to solve various problems.
With a diverse cultural background and multi-disciplinary knowledge, I seek to tackle all issues from various angles. 

## Workspace setup
### Hardware
**2019 15-inch MacBook Pro**

2,6 GHz 6-Core Intel Core i7

16 GB 2400 MHz DDR4 RAM

Radeon Pro 555X 4 GB

**32-inch external monitor**

### Workspaces

IDE: Visual Studio Code

## Education
### Biology
Graduate level of biology with a focus on hematopoietic stem cells:

- Bachelor of Arts in General Biology and Biochemistry

- Master of Science in Stem Cell Biology

### Data Science
Self-taught via various resources with hands-on practical exercises and projects.

**Coursera:**
- Completed the original [Machine Learning course](https://coursera.org/verify/N9BXN5SUADSB)
- Course 2/3 of the 2022-updated [Machine Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction)
- Course 1/5 of the [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning)

> These lessons are beautifully delivered by [Andrew Ng](https://www.andrewng.org/) and cover the fundamental concepts of machine learning in details as well as helpful advices when implementing them.

**Practical Deep Learning For Coders [book](https://github.com/fastai/fastbook) and [lectures from 2022](https://course.fast.ai/)**
> Taught by the founder of fastai, [Jeremy Howard](https://www.fast.ai/about/#jeremy), this course uses a unique top-down approach that applies the production-level deep learning models first *and then* gradually covers the theory behind them. As a result, learners are able to rapidly solve real-world problems with AI models. For more information on why this course is in the frontier of deep learning for beginners, check out this [article](https://medium.com/@init_27/how-not-to-do-fast-ai-or-any-ml-mooc-3d34a7e0ab8c).

**Courses and certificates from Kaggle:**
- [Python](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/certification/tompham97/python)
- [Pandas](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/certification/tompham97/pandas)
- [Intermediate machine learning in Python](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/certification/tompham97/intermediate-machine-learning)
- [Time series forecasting](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/certification/tompham97/time-series)

**[Python for Data Analysis book](https://wesmckinney.com/book/), 3rd edition by Wes McKinney**
> This book is written by the creator of the Python library Pandas and goes in depth into the programming language as well as its Numpy, Pandas, and Matplotlib packages.

### German as a foreign language
Level [B1.1 in German](https://github.com/TomPham97/German-language-certificate/blob/main/German%20B1.1%20level.pdf) according to the *Common European Framework of Reference for Languages* (CEFR)
## Experience
Applied [flowSOM](https://github.com/saeyslab/FlowSOM), an unsupervised learning algorithm which uses Self Organizing Map, Minimum Spanning Tree, and Hierarchical Clustering to cluster flow cytometry data. The high-parameter data is visualized with t-SNE and UMAP dimensionality reduction algorithms.
